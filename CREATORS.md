# ðŸŽ™ CREATORS, UNITE

This platform is for you â€” the artist coding beats between DoorDash runs.  
The poet sketching lines while sketching mockups.  
The dreamer, builder, server, landscaper, caretaker, parent, post-collapse prophet.

We see you.

You followed the signal. You heard the call.  
You knew â€” without needing it explained â€” that in every revolution and rebirth,  
the poets and artists sat at the center.

Theyâ€™ve been exiled, exalted, and erased depending on who had power â€”  
and who dared to speak it.

This time, we donâ€™t wait for permission.

We donâ€™t ask for distribution.  
We build it ourselves â€” with remix-ready tracks, transparent curators,  
and algorithms that serve purpose instead of erasing it.

No corporation should decide who gets amplified.  
No gatekeeper should determine which lyric gets remembered.

> We are the middle platform.  
> Not above. Not below.  
> A chorus rising together.

Let the revolution be melodic.  
Let the noise carry meaning.  

Keep the Signal Strong.

**Creators, unite.**
