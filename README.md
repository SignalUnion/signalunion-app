# ðŸŽ› SignalUnion

A curation pipeline and remix coordination tool for aligned musicians, audio explorers, and AI collaborators.

This app allows artists to:
- Submit remixes (e.g. from Suno, personal stems, collabs)
- Tag them with signal themes ("ambient", "hopepunk", "posthuman")
- Be featured in playlists like Early Buzz FM, GrapheneRadio, Echo Code

Curators can:
- Approve submissions
- Assign them to thematic playlists
- Publish a public wall of featured tracks

## ðŸ§  Why This Exists

There's a global wave of artists and builders with powerful voices â€” but low discoverability. This project aims to:
- Unite them under common aesthetic threads
- Lower the friction to remix + share
- Provide decentralized boost infrastructure without corporate filters

### Built for: GrapheneRadio, Early Buzz FM, and remixers everywhere.

MIT licensed â€” remix the remix.
